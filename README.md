# Carnalitas Historical Prostitution Doctrines

[Download from LoversLab](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/39623-carnalitas-prostitution-reimagined/)

A Carnalitas submod that adds a new setting for the *Default Prostitution Doctrine* game rule: *Full Historical*. This setting seeds all vanilla CK3 faiths with a doctrine corresponding to their historical tolerance of prostitution, as suggested by [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and verified by my own research.

The latest version is compatible with CK3 1.15.x and Carnalitas 2.9.

## Compatibility

This mod requires [Carnalitas](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/14207-carnalitas-unified-sex-mod-framework-for-ck3/) as a prerequisite (obviously). It is designed to complement [Carnalitas Prostitution Reimagined](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/39623-carnalitas-prostitution-reimagined/), but does not depend on it in any way and can be used just with Carnalitas. It is intentionally distributed as a standalone mod since it is only relevant for vanilla and should not be used with conversion mods. It should be compatible with all other Carnalitas mods, except mods that add a similar setting.

## Localization

This mod is currently available in English, French, German, Russian, Spanish, and Korean (translated by [@Xelren](https://www.loverslab.com/profile/4890252-xelren/)). For other languages, it uses the original English text as a placeholder.

## Historical Doctrines

The following categorization of vanilla faiths was generated by [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) after refinement by asking questions about concrete religions and faiths based on independent research.

### Abrahamic Religions

#### Christianity

Highly condemned, often with harsh penalties (Criminal):

* Cathar - Dualistic faith that viewed the physical world as corrupt; severely condemned sexual commerce
* Waldensian - Reform movement that emphasized moral purity and literal biblical interpretation
* Lollard - Followers of Wycliffe who advocated strict morality and criticized the Church's tolerance
* Bogomilist - Eastern dualistic movement that rejected physical pleasures
* Adamites - Despite practicing ritual nudity, would have condemned commercial sex as corrupting
* Insular Celtic - Early medieval Celtic Christianity with strong monastic influence and strict moral codes
* Messalian - Considered heretical partly for alleged sexual practices, but would condemn commercial sex
* Bosnian Church - Local variant with ascetic tendencies

Morally disapproved but pragmatically tolerated (Shunned):

* Catholic - Official condemnation but practical tolerance as a "necessary evil" in urban areas
* Orthodox - Similar to Catholicism, with periods of stricter enforcement
* Coptic - Egyptian Christianity with moral disapproval but practical accommodation
* Armenian Apostolic - Similar to other Eastern churches in practice
* Conversos - Jewish converts to Christianity who maintained some Jewish cultural practices
* Iconoclast - Despite theological differences with mainstream Orthodoxy, shared similar moral views
* Nestorian - Eastern Christian faith that spread along trade routes, practical in its approach
* Mozarabic Church - Christians under Muslim rule, practical accommodation to social realities
* Adoptionist - Theological heresy focused on Christ's nature rather than moral differences

Borderline Cases:

* Paulician - Often placed between Shunned and Accepted due to accusations by opponents of moral laxity, though historical evidence is contested and mostly comes from their critics
* Mozarabic Church - While generally Shunned, some Mozarabic communities under long-term Muslim rule might have developed more accepting practical attitudes in certain urban areas

No mainstream Christian faith in CK3's medieval setting would have "Accepted" prostitution in their official doctrine. The practical implementation varied widely by region, urban/rural divide, and the political power of religious authorities.

#### Dualism

Highly condemned, often with harsh penalties (Criminal):

* Manichean - Founded by prophet Mani; viewed the material world as evil and emphasized strict asceticism, including sexual purity
* Priscillianism - Spanish ascetic movement influenced by Gnosticism; advocated strict moral codes and sexual abstinence
* Sethianism - Gnostic sect focused on divine knowledge; viewed physical desires as traps of the material world

Morally disapproved but pragmatically tolerated (Shunned):

* Mandeaism - Gnostic sect centered on John the Baptist; focused on ritual purity but with practical approaches to social realities
* Sabianism - Star-worshipping faith with complex purity codes but practical social accommodation
* Valentinianism - Sophisticated Gnostic system; viewed spiritual knowledge as primary but had nuanced views on physical existence

Complex/Contested Cases (Accepted):

* Cainitism - Often accused of moral antinomianism, but historical evidence is limited and mostly comes from their opponents who may have exaggerated their moral laxity

The dualistic faiths in CK3 share a common theological thread of distinguishing between the spiritual/divine realm and the material/physical world, but they differed significantly in how this dualism translated to practical moral codes:

* Most viewed the material world (including physical pleasures) as inferior or corrupt
* Many advocated asceticism for spiritual adepts while recognizing ordinary followers might not maintain such standards
* Historical evidence for many of these faiths comes primarily from their opponents, who often accused them of either extreme asceticism or moral license

None of these faiths would have officially accepted prostitution in their doctrines, though accusations of secret libertinism were sometimes leveled against them by their religious opponents. These accusations were most likely exaggerations or misrepresentations used to discredit these minority faiths. The practical implementation of moral codes would have varied considerably based on the specific communities and historical circumstances of these often-persecuted religious minorities.

#### Islam

Highly condemned, often with harsh penalties (Criminal):

* Masmudi - Reformist Almohad movement known for moral purification campaigns
* Qarmatian - Revolutionary Ismaili offshoot with unique social structures but strict moral codes
* Azariqa - Extremely strict Kharijite sect known for harsh implementation of religious law
* Najdat - Another Kharijite sect with strict moral codes
* Sufri - Kharijite sect with somewhat moderated views but still strict on moral matters
* Quranist - Focused on direct Quranic interpretation without flexibility of traditional jurisprudence

Morally disapproved but pragmatically tolerated (Shunned):

* Ashari - Arabian Sunni tradition with stricter interpretations of Islamic law, but practical implementations varying significantly by region
* Maturidi - Persian Sunni Islam with pragmatic application of religious law
* Muwalladi - Iberian Sunni Islam influenced by proximity to Christian kingdoms
* Mutazila - Rationalist school more focused on reason in interpreting religious law
* Ismaili - Sevener Shia with esoteric interpretations but practical governance
* Nizari - Ismaili offshoot with pragmatic approach to ruling diverse populations
* Zayidi - Moderate Shia sect closer to Sunni in many practices
* Imami - Twelver Shia, officially condemned but practically regulated in urban centers
* Ibadi - Distinct tradition focused on moderate implementation of religious law

Officially criminal but with varied practical implementations (Criminal / Shunned):

* Alawite - Syncretic beliefs but socially conservative on practical moral matters
* Alevi - Mystical tradition with less emphasis on external religious law but still concerned with community morality
* Druze - Closed religious community with strict internal codes but varied interactions with outside world
* Ghulat - "Exaggerator" Shia sects with diverse beliefs but generally strict community boundaries
* Hafizi - Sub-set of Ismaili Shiites with similar practical approaches to mainstream Ismaili

All Islamic faiths in CK3 would officially condemn prostitution based on clear Quranic prohibitions, but the practical implementation varied widely. The distinction between "Criminal" and "Shunned" often depended more on the political circumstances, urban/rural divide, and specific rulers than on theological differences between faiths.

None of these Islamic faiths would reach an "Accepted" status regarding prostitution at the doctrinal level, though practical tolerance might have existed in certain cosmopolitan urban centers under specific rulers, particularly in places like medieval Cairo, Baghdad, or CÃ³rdoba during culturally open periods.

#### Judaism

Highly condemned, often with harsh penalties (Criminal):

* Karaism - Scriptural literalist movement rejecting rabbinic interpretation; would strictly follow biblical prohibitions against prostitution
* Samaritan - Ancient tradition adhering strictly to the Torah; maintained strict moral codes within their small communities
* Merkabah - Mystical tradition with focus on purity and ascent; would view prostitution as spiritually polluting

Morally disapproved but pragmatically tolerated (Shunned):

* Rabbinism - Mainstream rabbinic Judaism; officially condemned prostitution but recognized practical realities in urban settings
* Haymanot - Ethiopian Jewish tradition; combined Jewish law with some local cultural elements
* Malabarism - Indian Jewish tradition; adapted to local cultural contexts while maintaining core prohibitions
* Kabarism - Central Asian Jewish tradition; maintained Jewish moral codes while adapting to local conditions

All Jewish faiths in CK3's medieval setting would condemn prostitution at the doctrinal level based on Torah prohibitions. However, the practical implementation varied by community circumstances, geography, and external political pressures. The distinction between "Criminal" and "Shunned" categories often depended on:

* Urban vs. rural settings (urban communities generally more practical)
* Level of community autonomy (more autonomous communities could enforce stricter standards)
* Economic circumstances (poorer communities sometimes had less rigid enforcement)
* External pressures (Jewish communities under tolerant rulers might have more flexible approaches)

None of the Jewish faiths would reach an "Accepted" status regarding prostitution at the doctrinal level. The religion's focus on family structure, community continuity, and ritual purity meant prostitution remained morally problematic across all Jewish traditions, even where practical accommodations existed.

#### Yazidi

All Yazidi faiths condemned prostitution (due to strict community boundaries and emphasis on purity).

### Eastern Religions

#### Buddhism

Highly condemned, often with harsh penalties (Criminal):

* Vajrayana - In its purest doctrinal form, despite tantric elements, would condemn commercial exploitation; strict monastic codes would condemn prostitution while maintaining compassion for all involved

Morally disapproved but pragmatically tolerated (Shunned):

* Theravada - Conservative Buddhist tradition emphasizing monastic discipline; prostitution would violate precepts against sexual misconduct but practical regulation was common in Theravada societies
* Mahayana - Broader Buddhist tradition with emphasis on compassion; while maintaining moral disapproval, practical accommodation was common
* Lamaism - Tibetan Buddhism blending multiple traditions; while monastically strict, recognized practical realities of lay society

Complex, context-dependent attitudes (Shunned / Accepted):

* Ari - Pre-reform Burmese Buddhism with syncretic elements; more accommodating of pre-Buddhist cultural practices including less rigid sexual mores

Buddhist attitudes toward prostitution were characterized by:

* Clear moral disapproval based on precepts against sexual misconduct
* Emphasis on compassion toward individuals regardless of occupation
* Recognition of karma and personal choice rather than eternal damnation
* Practical accommodation when Buddhism became a state religion

No Buddhist tradition officially endorsed prostitution, but the response was typically less punitive than in Abrahamic traditions. The focus was more on:

* Offering paths to alternative livelihoods
* Viewing involvement in prostitution as a result of negative karma and unfortunate circumstances
* Maintaining compassion for all beings regardless of their actions

When Buddhist kingdoms implemented law codes, they typically regulated rather than harshly criminalized prostitution, placing it in the "Shunned" category in practice, even when doctrine might suggest stricter approaches.

#### Hinduism

Morally disapproved but pragmatically tolerated (Shunned):

* Vaishnavism - Focused on devotion to Vishnu; maintained traditional dharmic social structures with moral disapproval but practical regulation
* Advaitism - Philosophical tradition of non-dualism; while emphasizing spiritual pursuits over physical desires, took pragmatic approach to social realities
* Shaivism - Centered on Shiva worship; despite ascetic elements, practically accommodated social customs
* Smartism - Tradition honoring multiple deities; generally followed mainstream Hindu attitudes with practical tolerance
* Krishnaism - Devotion to Krishna; emphasized love and devotion while maintaining conventional moral boundaries
* Saura - Sun worship tradition; maintained traditional dharmic social structures

Regulated with limited moral stigma (Accepted):

* Srikula Shaktism - "Family of Sri" form of Goddess worship; more accommodating of female power and sexuality in religious context, though distinction maintained between sacred and commercial
* Kalikula Shaktism - "Family of Kali" form of Goddess worship; tantric elements and distinctive ritual practices sometimes included controlled ritual sexuality

Hindu attitudes toward prostitution were characterized by:

* Ambivalence rather than absolute condemnation - viewed through lens of dharma (duty/order) rather than sin
* Recognition of prostitution within the social order (with various terms like ganika, devadasi, vesya)
* Class/caste distinctions affecting how prostitution was viewed (courtesans vs. lower-status prostitutes)
* Regional variations in practice, particularly regarding temple traditions

Notable contextual factors:

* Temple connections - Some regions had traditions of women dedicated to temples (devadasis) whose status varied significantly by time and place
* Cultural sophistication - Classical Hindu texts like Kamasutra acknowledged courtesans as skilled professionals
* Dharmic framework - Viewed through lens of social duty and order rather than absolute moral prohibition
* Royal patronage - Court courtesans sometimes held respected positions in medieval Hindu kingdoms

No Hindu tradition officially promoted prostitution as morally positive, but practical accommodation was common, with significant variation by region, historical period, and specific faith tradition. The distinction between sacred ritual practices and commercial sex was generally maintained across all Hindu faiths.

#### Jainism

Highly condemned, often with harsh penalties (Criminal):

* Digambara - "Sky-clad" tradition with strictest ascetic practices; strongly condemned any sexual commerce based on principles of ahimsa (non-violence) and aparigraha (non-possession)
* Svetambara - "White-clad" tradition; slightly less severe than Digambara but still maintained strict moral codes including sexual ethics
* Yapaniya - Now-extinct compromise tradition between the other two; would have maintained similar strict sexual ethics

All Jain traditions would strongly condemn prostitution based on core Jain principles:

* Ahimsa (Non-violence) - Viewed prostitution as causing harm through exploitation and objectification
* Aparigraha (Non-possession) - Rejected treating bodies as commodities or possessions
* Brahmacharya (Sexual restraint) - Emphasized sexual restraint for both monastics and laypeople
* Anekantavada (Non-absolutism) - While acknowledging multiple perspectives on ethics, maintained clear position on sexual exploitation

Jainism's exceptionally strict ethical framework placed all forms of prostitution firmly in the "Criminal" category in terms of moral evaluation. When Jains had political influence, they would advocate against the practice, though their historical political power was limited compared to Hindu or Buddhist rulers.

No Jain tradition would have approached an "Accepted" or even "Shunned" position on prostitution, as the fundamental principles of the religion are incompatible with commercial sexual activity.

#### Taoism

Morally disapproved but pragmatically tolerated (Shunned):

* Quanzhen ("Complete Perfection") - Monastic tradition emphasizing internal alchemy and cultivation; advocated sexual restraint and would view prostitution as depleting vital essence

Complex attitudes with practical accommodation (Accepted):

* Zhengyi ("Orthodox Unity") - Less ascetic tradition involved with community rituals; maintained traditional Chinese family values but took pragmatic approach to social realities
* Shangqing ("Highest Clarity") - Visionary and mystical tradition; focused more on spiritual cultivation than enforcing moral codes on society

Taoist attitudes toward prostitution were characterized by:

* Balance philosophy - Viewed through lens of yin-yang harmony rather than absolute moral prohibition
* Vital essence concerns - Some traditions concerned with conservation of sexual energy (jing)
* Integration with Confucian values - Often adopted mainstream Chinese social norms on family and sexuality
* Practical coexistence - In medieval Chinese society, religious and secular domains were often separate

Important contextual factors:

* Medieval Chinese society generally regulated rather than eliminated prostitution
* Taoist religious authorities rarely held direct political power to criminalize social practices
* Different Taoist schools varied in their emphasis on asceticism versus social integration
* The "Three Teachings" (Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism) influenced each other in medieval China

No Taoist tradition actively promoted prostitution as morally positive, but the religion's focus on natural balance, pragmatism, and integration with existing social structures meant that extreme condemnation was also rare. The approach was generally to regulate rather than eliminate, placing most Taoist attitudes in the Shunned to Borderline Accepted categories.

#### Zoroastrianism

Highly condemned, often with harsh penalties (Criminal):

* Mazdayasna - Orthodox Zoroastrianism; viewed prostitution as defiling sacred elements and violating moral principles of good thoughts, words, and deeds
* Zurvanism - Philosophical branch focusing on time; maintained traditional Zoroastrian moral codes
* Gayomarthianism - Theological variant focusing on the first man; maintained strict purity codes
* Khurmazta - Central Asian variant; emphasized purity and righteousness

Morally disapproved but pragmatically tolerated (Shunned):

* Urartuism (Arewordik) - Ancient Armenian religion with Zoroastrian influences; more pragmatic in social regulation
* Afridunism - Daylamite folk religion; syncretistic approach with practical accommodation

Complex/Contested Cases (Shunned):

* Mazdakism - Social reform movement advocating communal property; while traditionally accused of advocating communal women, historical evidence suggests this was likely propaganda by opponents
* Khurramism - Revolutionary movement with some relaxed social attitudes; accused by opponents of moral license but evidence is contested

Zoroastrian attitudes toward prostitution were characterized by:

* Purity concerns - Focus on ritual purity and avoidance of pollution
* Cosmic dualism - Prostitution associated with forces of chaos and evil
* Communal integrity - Emphasis on proper family structures and social order
* Water sanctity - Particular concern about bodily fluids polluting sacred water

The orthodox Zoroastrian tradition (Mazdayasna) would have been among the strictest in condemning prostitution, viewing it as a form of ritual pollution and moral corruption. When Zoroastrians held political power in the Sasanian Empire, they implemented laws against prostitution, though practical enforcement varied by period and ruler.

The accusations of sexual license against reformist movements like Mazdakism and Khurramism should be viewed skeptically, as similar accusations were commonly used to discredit religious and social reform movements throughout history.

### Paganism

Regulated with limited stigma or fully integrated (Accepted):

* Akom - West African tradition with pragmatic approach to sexuality
* Bon - though influenced by Buddhism, retained more accepting pre-Buddhist elements
* Donyipoloism - tribal faith with less rigid sexual codes
* Hellenism - particularly in urban centers and areas influenced by Greek and Roman traditions
* Kushitism - African traditions with more integrated views of sexuality
* Mundhumism - tribal faith with less institutionalized moral restrictions
* North African - syncretic traditions with Carthaginian/Berber influences
* Waaqism - East African tradition with less rigid sexual codes
* Bori
* Orisha
* Roog
* Generic West African

Morally disapproved but pragmatically tolerated (Shunned):

* Baltic
* Basque Paganism
* Finno-Ugric - including Suomenusko
* Germanic - except for some more urbanized variants that might be more accepting
* Magyarism
* Paganism
* Qiangic
* Siberian
* Slavic
* Tengrism
* Zunism - sun worship with emphasis on righteousness might lead to stricter views

Exceptions:

* Within Germanic paganism, the Reformed Norse faith might take a stricter view (Shunned or even Criminal) if reformed with specific virtues emphasizing family values
* Within Hellenism, the Hellenic faith specifically focused on Artemis or Athena cults might be more restrictive (Shunned) than those centered on Aphrodite or Dionysus (Accepted)
* Within Tengrism, more settled and Islamic-influenced variants might trend toward Shunned or even Criminal attitudes
